# PyCursor-Agent

A powerful Python wrapper for the [Cursor Agent CLI](https://cursor.com/en-US/cli), allowing you to build general-purpose autonomous agents using Cursor's frontier models and context management capabilities.

## 🚀 Motivation

1.  **Reuse Cursor's Power**: Leverage Cursor Agent's state-of-the-art context management, tool-use capabilities, and deep codebase understanding programmatically.
2.  **Cost Effective**: Use Cursor's competitive API pricing for your own automated workflows and general agents.
3.  **General Agent Framework**: Build custom scripts, CI/CD integrations, or complex multi-step agents that interact with your filesystem and run commands autonomously.
4.  **Multi-Model Support**: Easily switch between top-tier models like `gemini-3-flash`, `gemini-3-pro`, `opus-4.5-thinking`, and `gpt-5.2`.

Check available models using:
```bash
cursor-agent --model list-models --print "hi"
```

## 🛠 Under the Hood: All is Agent
It is important to note that the underlying `cursor-agent` CLI primarily operates in **Agent Mode**. The four modes provided by this SDK (`ask`, `agent`, `planner`, `debug`) are achieved through **Prompt Engineering**.

### ⚠️ Warning: Force Mode
By default, this SDK uses Cursor's **Force Mode** (`--force`). In this mode, the Agent is automatically granted permission to execute all operations, including modifying files and running terminal commands. 
**This can be dangerous if the Agent performs unintended actions. Please use it with caution and avoid running it in sensitive environments without proper oversight.**

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Prerequisites
You **must** have the Cursor CLI installed and be logged in on your machine.
Visit [cursor.com/cli](https://cursor.com/en-US/cli) to install.

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)
We highly recommend using a virtual environment:

1.  **Create environment**: `python -m venv venv`
2.  **Activate environment**:
    *   **Windows**: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
    *   **macOS/Linux**: `source venv/bin/activate`

### 3. Install the SDK
```bash
pip install pycursor_agent
```

## 🛠 Usage

### Import the Package and Initialize Client
Specify a `workspace` directory to let the Agent "see" and "manage" your project files.

```python
from pycursor_agent import Client

# Initialize client with a specific workspace
client = Client(workspace="./my_project")
```

### Context Management Strategies
You can manage conversation context in at least two ways:

1.  **File-based Context**: Leverage the Agent's ability to read and write files within the workspace. One Agent can write a plan or state to a file, and another (or the same one in a later call) can read it to continue the task.
2.  **Chat Session Resumption**: Use Cursor's native `chatId` to resume previous conversations.

```python
# Create a new chat session
chat_id = client.create_chat()

# Use the chat_id to maintain history
client.agent("My name is Alice", chat_id=chat_id)
response = client.agent("What is my name?", chat_id=chat_id)
print(response) # Should output something like "Your name is Alice"
```

### Primary Methods

1.  **Agent Mode (`.agent`)**: Default autonomous mode. Can read/write files and execute terminal commands.
2.  **Ask Mode (`.ask`)**: Pure Q&A. AI is instructed not to modify files.
3.  **Planner Mode (`.plan`)**: Generates an execution plan without performing actions.
4.  **Debug Mode (`.debug`)**: Focused on bug hunting and fixing.

## 🧪 Testing
The project includes a `test_sdk.py` script to verify all modes and features, the results will be placed in `./test_results`.
```bash
python3 test_sdk.py
```
