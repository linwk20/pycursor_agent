=== Cursor Agent SDK Test Report ===

=== PART 1: CONTEXT TESTS ===
--- 1.1 Testing Chat Session Resumption ---
Created new chat session: xxxxxxx-abf2-485a-9313-ea92ad6c9d13
Sent: My name is Cursor Explorer.
Sent: What is my name?
Result: Your name is Cursor Explorer. How can I help you today?

--- 1.2 Testing File-based Context ---
Step 1: I have written 'Context test: Step 1 passed' into `context_file.txt`.
Step 2: The file `context_file.txt` contains the following information:

```1:1:test_results/context_file.txt
Context test: Step 1 passed
```

**Summary:**
The file indicates that the first step of a context test has been completed successfully.


=== PART 2: FUNCTIONALITY TESTS ===
--- 2.1 Testing 'agent' mode (standard) ---
Result: I have created the file `mode_test.txt` in the `test_results` directory with the current date and time.

```1:1:/home/lwk/ur_research/cursor-agent-sdk/test_results/mode_test.txt
Fri Jan  2 09:08:57 AM EST 2026
```

--- 2.2 Testing 'ask' mode ---
Result: The capital of France is Paris.

--- 2.3 Testing 'planner' mode ---
Result: To build a simple CLI-based Todo app in Python, I have developed the following plan. This plan focuses on creating a functional, persistent, and easy-to-use command-line application.

### Phase 1: Requirements & Data Design
*   **Core Features:**
    *   Add a new task.
    *   List all tasks (with status).
    *   Mark a task as completed.
    *   Delete a task.
*   **Data Structure:**
    *   Each task will be an object with: `id` (integer), `description` (string), and `completed` (boolean).
*   **Storage:**
    *   Use a JSON file (`todos.json`) for local persistence so tasks remain after the program exits.

### Phase 2: Project Setup
*   Create a new directory `todo_app` or a single file `todo.py`.
*   Initialize the storage file if it doesn't exist.

### Phase 3: Core Implementation
1.  **Storage Logic:** Create helper functions to `load_tasks()` from and `save_tasks()` to the JSON file.
2.  **Task Management Logic:**
    *   `add_task(description)`: Appends a new task to the list.
    *   `list_tasks()`: Displays tasks in a formatted table or list.
    *   `complete_task(task_id)`: Toggles or sets the `completed` status.
    *   `delete_task(task_id)`: Removes a task from the list.
3.  **CLI Interface:** Use Python's `argparse` library to handle command-line arguments (e.g., `python todo.py add "Buy milk"`).

### Phase 4: Refinement & Testing
*   Add error handling for invalid IDs or missing descriptions.
*   Provide clear console output (e.g., "Task added successfully!").
*   Optional: Add colors using a library like `colorama` or simple ANSI codes for better readability.

### Phase 5: Documentation
*   Update the `README.md` with instructions on how to install and use the Todo app.

**Would you like me to proceed with implementing this plan, or would you prefer a different approach (e.g., a web-based app or using a different language)?**

--- 2.4 Testing 'debug' mode ---
Result: I have fixed the `power` function in `buggy.py`. The original implementation used addition (`+`) instead of exponentiation (`**`).

```1:2:/home/lwk/ur_research/cursor-agent-sdk/test_results/buggy.py
def power(a, b):
    return a ** b  # Corrected logic: exponentiation instead of addition
```
